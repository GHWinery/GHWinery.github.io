- pH: 2.9-3.2
- TA: 8.0-11.0 g/L

**Winemaking Notes:**
- Temperature controlled
- Stainless steel typical
- Residual sugar options
- Excellent aging potential

## Harvest Timing Considerations

### Physiological Ripeness Indicators

**Visual Assessment:**
- Seed color (brown indicates maturity)
- Stem lignification
- Skin color development
- Berry taste and texture

**Chemical Analysis:**
- Sugar accumulation (Brix)
- Acid levels (TA)
- pH development
- Phenolic ripeness (reds)

### Weather Factors

**Monitoring:**
- Extended forecast review
- Rain predictions
- Temperature extremes
- Wind events

**Decision Points:**
- Harvest before rain events
- Avoid heat spikes during harvest
- Morning picks for aromatics
- Nighttime picks in hot conditions

## Clone and Rootstock Information

### Maintaining Diversity

We maintain detailed records of:
- Clone selections
- Rootstock varieties
- Planting dates
- Vineyard blocks
- Performance history

    Complete clone and rootstock information is maintained in the vineyard management system.

## Quality Grading

### Premium Grade
- Optimal ripeness parameters
- Excellent cluster health
- Balanced chemistry
- Reserved for reserve wines

### Standard Grade
- Good ripeness and health
- Within acceptable parameters
- Main production wines

- Used for value wines or sold

## Sustainability Practices

Our vineyard management emphasizes:

- **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**
- **Water conservation**
- **Cover cropping**
- **Soil health programs**
- **Wildlife habitat preservation**

## Variety-Specific Challenges

### Common Issues by Variety

| Variety | Primary Concerns | Prevention |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Pinot Noir | Bunch rot, early ripening | Canopy management, timely harvest |
| Cabernet | Late ripening, bird pressure | Bird netting, extended hang time |
| Chardonnay | Powdery mildew | Spray programs, canopy management |
| Sauvignon Blanc | Rapid acid loss | Monitor closely, early harvest option |

## Future Variety Trials

We continuously evaluate new varieties and clones:
- Trial block locations
- Experimental winemaking
- Market research
- Climate adaptation
