## Sampling Protocol

### Field Sampling

**Random Sampling Method:**

1. Walk vineyard in zigzag pattern
2. Collect berries from multiple locations
3. Include sun-exposed and shaded fruit
4. Sample from top, middle, and bottom of clusters
5. Collect 200+ berries per block

**Sample Collection:**

- Use clean sampling bags
- Label with: Block, Row, Date, Time
- Keep samples cool
- Process within 2 hours

### Lab Analysis

**Measure and record:**

- Brix (°Bx)
- pH
- Titratable Acidity (TA)
- Temperature

**Track trends:**
- Plot data over time
- Compare to previous vintages
- Identify harvest windows

## Harvest Decision Criteria

### Primary Factors

**Sugar Levels:**
- Target Brix by variety
- Consider alcohol targets
- Account for fermentation loss

**Acid Balance:**
- pH targets by variety
- TA considerations
- Buffering capacity

**Phenolic Ripeness (Reds):**
- Seed maturity
- Tannin development
- Color extraction potential

**Flavor Development:**
- Sensory evaluation
- Varietal character
- Balance assessment

### Secondary Factors

**Weather:**
- Forecast review (7-10 days)
- Rain predictions
- Heat events
- Wind conditions

**Operational Capacity:**
- Tank availability
- Crew scheduling
- Equipment readiness
- Lab capacity

**Market Timing:**
- Winemaking goals
- Style objectives
- Release schedules

## Harvest Logistics

### Picking Operations

**Morning Harvest (Recommended for whites):**
- Start: 6:00 AM
- Cooler fruit temperatures
- Better aromatics retention
- Higher acid levels

**Day Harvest:**
- Reds and bulk fruit
- Warm fruit acceptable
- Faster picking pace

**Night Harvest:**
- Premium whites
- Hot climate conditions
- Requires lighting
- Higher labor costs

### Transportation

**Bin Management:**
- Clean bins ready
- Sufficient quantity
- Rotation system
- Quick turnaround

**Truck Scheduling:**
- Coordinate with pickers
- Stagger arrivals
- Avoid receiving backlog
- Direct communication

### Receiving Area Preparation

**Setup:**
- Clear and clean crush pad
- Position equipment
- Set up sorting tables
- Prepare reception bins
- Have ice available

**Staffing:**
- Forklift operator
- Crush operator
- Sorting team (2-4 people)
- Lab technician
- Supervisor

## Communication Plan

### Team Briefing

**Daily Meetings:**
- Morning: Review day's plan
- Midday: Progress check
- Evening: Next day prep

**Information to Share:**
- Harvest schedule
- Variety and blocks
- Expected tonnage
- Special instructions
- Safety reminders

### Contact List

Maintain updated contacts for:
- Vineyard manager
- Picking crews
- Truck drivers
- Crush crew
- Winemaker
- Lab staff
- Maintenance support
- Emergency services

## Scheduling Matrix

### Sample Harvest Schedule

| Date | Variety | Block | Tons | Crew | Start Time | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|------|------|------------|-------|
| 9/15 | Sauv Blanc | 3A | 8 | Team A | 6:00 AM | Cool pick |
| 9/15 | Chardonnay | 7B | 12 | Team B | 7:00 AM | Tank 5 |
