# Crushing & Pressing

## Fruit Reception and Processing

Proper crushing and pressing techniques are critical for wine quality and extraction efficiency.

## Pre-Processing Inspection

### Fruit Quality Assessment

**Upon Arrival:**

1. **Visual Inspection**
   - Overall cluster health
   - Rot or damage levels
   - Ripeness uniformity
   - MOG (material other than grapes) content

2. **Temperature Check**
   - Record fruit temperature
   - Target: <70°F for whites, <80°F for reds
   - Add ice if needed

3. **Chemical Analysis**
   - Brix
   - pH  
   - Titratable acidity (TA)
   - Compare to field samples

### Documentation

Record in the harvest log:
- Vineyard source
- Variety
- Weight/tonnage
- Quality grade
- Chemistry results
- Processing decisions

## Red Wine Processing

### Destemming and Crushing

**Equipment Setup:**

- Clean and sanitize destemmer/crusher
- Set destemmer cage speed
- Adjust stem rejection
- Position must pump
- Prepare destination vessel

**Process Steps:**

1. **Feeding**
   - Use forklift to tip bins slowly
   - Steady, consistent flow
   - Avoid overloading

2. **Destemming**
   - Monitor stem separation
   - Adjust cage speed as needed
   - Visual inspection of stems
   - Target: <2% stem inclusion

3. **Crushing**
   - Gentle berry breakage
   - Avoid seed crushing
   - Some whole berries acceptable
   - Transfer to fermenter

**Whole Cluster Options:**

- Percentage to include (0-100%)
- Hand-sort clusters if using
- Place in fermenter before crushed fruit
- Document percentage used

### Must Handling

**Sulfur Dioxide Addition:**

- Calculate dose based on pH and fruit condition
- Typical range: 30-50 ppm
- Dissolve in water before adding
- Mix thoroughly
- Allow 2-4 hours contact time

**Adjustments:**

- Acid additions if needed
- Enzyme additions (if used)
- Yeast nutrients
- Record all additions

**Cold Soaking (Optional):**

- Chill must to 45-55°F
- Duration: 3-7 days
- Monitor temperature
- Watch for spontaneous fermentation
- Add dry ice or use glycol

## White Wine Processing

### Handling Considerations

**Oxidation Prevention:**
- Minimize air exposure
- Add SO₂ promptly
- Keep fruit cold
- Process quickly

### Whole Cluster Pressing

**For Premium Whites:**

1. **Sorting**
   - Remove leaves and MOG
   - Reject damaged clusters
   - Hand-sort if quality tier requires

2. **Press Loading**
   - Fill press gently
   - Don't overfill
   - Distribute evenly
   - Close press

3. **Press Program**
   - See detailed press cycles below

### Crushed and Pressed Whites

**Crushing:**

- Gentle destemming
- Minimal crushing pressure
- Immediate press
- Short skin contact (<2 hours)

**Enzyme Addition:**

- Pectolytic enzymes
- Dose: per manufacturer
- Add to crusher or press
- Allow contact time
- Improves juice extraction

## Pressing Operations

### Press Types and Settings

**Bladder Press:**

| Cycle | Pressure | Duration | Purpose |
|-------|----------|----------|---------|
| Free Run | 0 bar | 15 min | Drain free juice |
| Press 1 | 0.5 bar | 20 min | Light press |
| Press 2 | 1.0 bar | 20 min | Medium press |
| Press 3 | 1.5 bar | 20 min | Firm press |
| Final | 2.0 bar | 15 min | Hard press |

**Basket Press:**

- Apply pressure gradually
- Monitor juice flow
- Cake building phase
- Multiple press cycles
- Hand-break cake between cycles

### Press Fractions

**Free Run:**
- First juice to flow
- Highest quality
- Lower phenolics
- Premium wine use

**Light Press:**
- First pressure application
- Good quality
- Most volume
- Main wine component

**Heavy Press:**
- Final pressings
- Higher phenolics
- More tannic
- Consider separate fermentation

### Juice/Must Transfer

**Settling (Whites):**

- Transfer to settling tank
- Add SO₂ if not already added
- Chill to 40-45°F
- Settle 12-24 hours
- Monitor clarity
- Rack clean juice

**Red Must:**

- Pump to fermentation vessel
- Add yeast nutrients
- Verify SO₂ levels
- Mix thoroughly
- Check temperature

## Equipment Operation

### Destemmer/Crusher Safety

!!! danger "Safety Critical"
    - Lockout/tagout for maintenance
    - Keep hands clear of moving parts
    - Use push tools, not hands
    - Emergency stop accessible
    - Guards in place

**Operating Procedure:**

1. Pre-operation check
2. Clear area of personnel
3. Start machine empty
4. Begin feeding fruit
5. Monitor operation continuously
6. Shutdown: run empty, then stop

### Press Operation

**Pre-Start Checklist:**

- [ ] Press cleaned and sanitized
- [ ] Drain valve closed
- [ ] Bladder/basket undamaged
- [ ] Safety guards in place

- [ ] Hoses connected

**During Operation:**

- Monitor pressure gauges
- Watch juice quality
- Check for leaks
- Listen for unusual sounds
- Track press fractions
- Record data

**Post-Operation:**

- Drain completely
- Remove pomace promptly
- Clean immediately
- Sanitize all contact surfaces
- Inspect for damage
- Store properly

## Pomace Management

### Red Pomace

- Drain excess wine
- Transfer to pomace bin
- Arrange disposal/composting

**If Pressing Multiple Lots:**

- Clean press between lots
- Prevent cross-contamination

- Process immediately after pressing
- Don't allow to sit
- Compost or dispose properly

- **Distillation:** If equipment available

## Quality Control Checkpoints

- [ ] Visual assessment documented
- [ ] Chemistry analysis complete
- [ ] Processing plan confirmed

### During Processing

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Solution |

| Excessive stem | Cage speed too fast | Reduce destemmer speed |
| Crushed seeds | Too much force | Adjust crusher gap |
| Poor juice extraction | Improper press cycle | Adjust pressure/timing |
| Oxidized juice | Too much air exposure | Add SO₂, reduce processing time |
| High phenolics | Too much pressure | Lighter press cycles |
