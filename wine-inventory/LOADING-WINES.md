# Loading Your Wine List

I've created an `initial-wines.json` file with all 28 of your wines pre-populated!

## How to Load the Data

### Option 1: Import via the Interface (Easiest)
1. Open the wine inventory page in your browser
2. Click the "Import Data" button
3. Select the `initial-wines.json` file
4. Confirm the import

### Option 2: Auto-load on First Visit (Recommended)
I can modify the app.js to automatically load this data on the first visit. Would you like me to do that?

## What's Included

All 28 wines are categorized by type:
- **Red Wines**: Merlot Res, Cab Reserve, GH Red, Sinfandel, Chambourcin, Rich Dan

## Note
The varietal field is filled in where it matches the wine name (e.g., Merlot, Chardonnay). Feel free to adjust any of these details through the interface!
